# SVG-photos

## Description

The motivation for this project was to show how the routs I made can work fluently together. In building this I showed my abilities to creat a photo while also creating a test for my shapes. This solves how someone can sve time in creating a logo while using code. What I have learned from this project was to creat a test for my code and use routs to creat my photos.


## Features

With in the intergrated terminal you will be able to answer four questions including a option of choseing one of three shapes. In doing so you will get a console.log in the terminal saying that it has Generated logo.svg. This will create a file that will show the photo that you have created.

Also you will be able to test the the shapes to ensure that they render correctly.
